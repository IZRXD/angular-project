Angular Project - Gamings
This repository serves as a basic starting point for Angular projects. It's designed to be a clean, minimal example that you can easily build upon. While it currently doesn't contain a specific application, it includes the essential structure and configuration for a new Angular project.

Features:

Clean Project Structure: The project follows Angular's recommended directory structure for maintainability and scalability.

Ready to Build: The project is configured to be built using the Angular CLI.

Basic Routing (Optional, depending on branch): Some branches might include a basic routing setup for demonstration purposes. Check the branch names for details.

Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/IZRXD/angular-project.git
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary Node packages:

cd angular-project
npm install
Use code with caution.
Bash
Serve the Application:

Start the development server:

ng serve

This will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:4200/. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a rebuild and refresh of the browser.

Build for Production:

To build the application for production, use the following command:

ng build --prod
Use code with caution.

This will create an optimized version of your application in the dist/ folder.

Adding Components: Create new components using the Angular CLI (ng generate component <component-name>).

Implementing Services: Create services to handle data fetching and other business logic.

Integrating Libraries: Add third-party libraries as needed.

Implementing Routing: Set up routing to navigate between different parts of your application.

Adding Styling: Customize the styling using CSS or a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less.
